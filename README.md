# TicketParser

# How to use

To build the application do:

`npm install && npm run build`

To run the application do:

`node ./build/main.js`

Running the application will parse the file _test.html_ and store the results in _my-result.json_

# TODO
1. Tests
2. Refactor and clean the code
3. Add DI mechanism for parser switching
